# A simple Windows dark/light mode switcher

Every time you run this application it'll toggle between light and dark mode. It's just a few lines of code and 4KiB.

As I wrote it for my own purposes, it's currently not configurable and does not handle the `ColorPrevalence` setting ("Show accent color on Start and taskbar"). That setting had to be disabled when the light theme was activated, but that's not necessary with the latest versions of Windows anymore.
